- **Contact Us Page:** Vosmos includes a dedicated "Contact Us" page, offering users a straightforward way to reach out for support or inquiries.

- **Favorite Items:** Users can create and manage a list of favorite items, allowing them to curate their preferences and easily revisit items of interest.

- **Return Policy Page:** Vosmos is committed to transparency, and the Return Policy page outlines the procedures and guidelines for returns, ensuring a clear understanding for customers.

- **Product Details Page:** Each product is presented with detailed information, providing users with comprehensive insights into the item they are considering.

- **Product Customization:** Vosmos empowers users to personalize their clothing items by offering a product customization page. Users can upload their designs and see them applied to their customized t-shirts.

- **Frontend Template:** The project utilizes a frontend template from Colorlib, which has been carefully modified and integrated to harmonize with the backend functionalities.
